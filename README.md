## GitHub Actions: Starter Workflow
This repository demonstrates a basic GitHub Actions workflow for automating tasks when code is pushed to the main branch. The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/starter-workflow.yml.

## What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool that allows you to automate tasks directly in your GitHub repository. With GitHub Actions, you can:

> Build, test, and deploy your code.

> Automate repetitive tasks.

> Integrate with third-party services using pre-built actions.

## Starter Workflow Overview
- The workflow file, starter-workflow.yml, does the following:

- Triggers when code is pushed to the main branch.

- Runs a simple job called example-job on an Ubuntu environment.

- Checks out the repository code.

- Prints a "Hello, world!" message.

## File Location
The workflow file is located at:

.github/workflows/starter-workflow.yml
